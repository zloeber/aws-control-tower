# AWS Control Tower

This repo aggregates a handful of aws control tower notes and code snippets.

To use this one should have mise installed and perhaps zsh as the default shell.

In cloudshell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zloeber/aws-control-tower.git
cd aws-control-tower
```

# Configure

`./configure.sh`

If you are lucky that will mostly work be aware that mise in your shell by default is highly recommended.
